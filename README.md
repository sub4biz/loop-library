# Loop Library

Loop Library has two separate but related parts in this repository:

| Part | What it is | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Loop Library website** | The public catalog where people and agents can browse published loops, read them, and copy their prompts. No installation is required. | [Live website](https://signals.forwardfuture.ai/loop-library/) · shell in [`site/`](site/), database and rendering in [`worker/`](worker/) |
| **Loop Library skill** | An optional installable guide that helps an AI agent discover, find, audit, repair, adapt, or design loops through conversation. It uses the website's live catalog when recommending published loops. | source in [`skills/loop-library/`](skills/loop-library/) |

The website is the library; the skill is a companion way to work with it. You
can browse or give an agent the website without installing the skill. Installing
the skill adds the guided workflow, but it does not install or host the website.

Agents that do not have the skill can use the published
[agent guide](https://signals.forwardfuture.ai/loop-library/agents/),
[agent instructions](https://signals.forwardfuture.ai/loop-library/llms.txt),
[JSON catalog](https://signals.forwardfuture.ai/loop-library/catalog.json), or
[plain-text catalog](https://signals.forwardfuture.ai/loop-library/catalog.txt)
directly.

Each published loop tells an agent what to do, how to check its work, what to
try next, and when to stop.

## What is a loop?

Most prompts ask an agent to do something once. A loop gives the agent a way to
learn from the result and take the next useful step.

For example, a one-shot prompt might say:

> Make this website faster.

A loop adds the feedback that makes the work repeatable:

> Find the slowest page, make one focused improvement, and measure it again.
> Keep the change only if it helps. Repeat until every page meets the target or
> another pass stops producing a meaningful improvement.

Think of a loop as a playbook with feedback built in. It is useful when the
first attempt probably will not be the final answer, such as fixing production
errors, improving test coverage, reviewing a product, or keeping documentation
current.

A good loop answers four simple questions:

- What is the agent trying to accomplish?
- How will it know whether the latest attempt worked?
- What should it do with what it learned?
- When should it finish or ask for help?

## Why loops are powerful

AI agents can move quickly, but an open-ended instruction like "keep improving
this" leaves too much room for guessing. A loop gives the work a clear finish
line and a consistent way to judge progress.

That makes the work easier to trust and easier to repeat. The agent can compare
results instead of relying on confidence, keep improvements instead of merely
making changes, and stop when it succeeds or stops making progress. The same
loop can also be reused by another person or agent without rebuilding the
workflow from scratch.

Loops are not permission for an agent to run forever. The best ones are
deliberately bounded. They include a real check, a clear stopping point, and a
moment to hand control back to a person when judgment or approval is needed.

## What the Loop Library skill does

The Loop Library skill gives your agent direct access to the ideas in the
library. You can use it to:

- Discover repeated work in a codebase, coding threads, or both and turn the
  strongest qualified candidate into a loop.
- Find a published loop that fits what you are trying to get done.
- Audit an existing loop for weak checks, unsafe actions, or unclear stopping
  behavior, then repair only the material problems.
- Adapt a useful loop to your tools, limits, and definition of success.
- Design a new loop through a short, plain-language conversation.
- Turn the result into a compact prompt you can use right away.

The skill checks the live catalog when it recommends a published loop. It does
not quietly start schedules, change production, or send messages on your
behalf. Those actions still require the normal permissions and approvals.

## Install the skill

You need Node.js and `npx`. Pick the platform you use:

| Platform | Install command |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `npx skills add Forward-Future/loop-library --skill loop-library --agent codex -g -y` |
| Cursor | `npx skills add Forward-Future/loop-library --skill loop-library --agent cursor -g -y` |
| Claude Code | `npx skills add Forward-Future/loop-library --skill loop-library --agent claude-code -g -y` |

To install it for all three at once:

```bash
npx skills add Forward-Future/loop-library \
  --skill loop-library \
  --agent codex \
  --agent cursor \
  --agent claude-code \
  -g -y
```

Using another agent? Run the interactive installer and choose from the agents
it detects:

```bash
npx skills add Forward-Future/loop-library --skill loop-library -g
```

The command parts mean:

- `Forward-Future/loop-library` is the GitHub repository to install from.
- `--skill loop-library` selects this skill from the repository.
- `--agent ...` selects the agent that should receive it.
- `-g` makes it available in all your projects. Leave `-g` off to install it
  only in the current project.
- `-y` accepts the install prompts. Leave it off if you want to review the
  choices interactively.

If an agent was already open and the skill does not appear, restart that agent.

## Invoke the skill

The slash-command experience differs slightly by platform:

- **Codex:** type `/skills`, choose **Loop Library**, then enter your request.
  You can also mention it directly with `$loop-library`.
- **Cursor:** type `/` in Agent chat, search for `loop-library`, select it, and
  add your request. You can also type `/loop-library` directly.
- **Claude Code:** type `/loop-library` followed by your request.

You can also describe a matching task normally. These agents can load the
skill automatically when your request clearly calls for it, but explicit
invocation is the most predictable way to start.

For example, in Codex you can write:

```text
$loop-library Analyze this codebase and my coding threads for repeated work, then turn the strongest candidate into a reliable loop.
```

## Use Loop Library

You do not need to know loop terminology. Invoke the skill and say what you
want to get done. It can take five paths:

| Path | What it does | Example request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Discover** | Inspects an authorized codebase, coding-thread history, or both for repeated work, then turns the strongest qualified candidate into a bounded loop. | `Analyze this repository and my coding threads for work we have done more than once. Turn the best candidate into a loop.` |
| **Find** | Searches the live catalog and recommends up to three published loops. It does not run them. | `Find a published loop for keeping our documentation current.` |
| **Loop Doctor** | Audits a loop you paste or name, explains material weaknesses, and repairs only those problems. | `Audit this loop and repair only material problems: [paste loop]` |
| **Adapt** | Tailors a useful loop to your real tools, limits, schedule, and definition of success. | `Adapt the Overnight Docs Sweep to this repository and our existing checks.` |
| **Design** | Asks a few plain-language questions, then creates a short, bounded loop when the catalog has no good fit. | `Help me design a loop that turns customer feedback into verified fixes.` |

For example, in Claude Code or Cursor:

```text
/loop-library Find a loop for improving test reliability.
```

In Codex, choose **Loop Library** from `/skills`, then send:

```text
Find a loop for improving test reliability.
```

### Discover loops from your work

Discovery looks for recurring engineering work in the sources you put in
scope. In a codebase, that can include scripts, CI and deployment configuration,
tests, runbooks, maintenance commands, and repeated lifecycle patterns. In
coding threads, it groups equivalent completed work even when the wording
differs.

The skill requires at least two distinct thread occurrences before calling work
repeated. A code pattern without run history is labeled as a potential loop, not
proven recurrence. It then checks whether fresh feedback can change the next
action, whether success can be verified, and whether the work has clear limits,
stopping behavior, and approval boundaries. It also checks the live catalog to
avoid recreating an existing loop.

The skill can inspect only repositories and coding threads that your agent can
access and that you place in scope. If thread history is unavailable, it uses
the codebase evidence and says so. A discovery result includes compact source
evidence and either a new loop, an adaptation of a published loop, a short
candidate slate when your choice matters, or a clean no-op when nothing truly
fits.

When the skill finds or creates the right loop, it gives you a prompt to use
with your agent. Review any placeholders, then ask the agent to run that prompt
in the project you want it to work on. Selecting a loop does not start a
schedule, deploy code, delete data, send messages, or grant new permissions;
you must request those actions explicitly.

Every published loop also includes a few useful parts:

- **Use when** explains the problem the loop is meant to solve.
- **Prompt** is the copy-ready instruction for your agent.
- **Verify** defines the evidence that proves the work succeeded.
- **Steps** show the feedback cycle in a more readable form.
- **Notes** call out practical limits, risks, or setup details.
- **Related loops** point to nearby workflows that may fit better.

### Publish a loop

Public loops are stored in the catalog database attached to the Cloudflare
Worker. Publishing a reviewed loop does not require a GitHub commit or a static
site deployment.

Copy `worker/examples/loop.json` somewhere outside the repository, fill in the
record, and run:

```bash
LOOP_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... \
  npm --prefix worker run loop:publish -- /path/to/loop.json
```

The command validates the record and publishes the homepage row, detail page,
JSON/Markdown/plain-text catalogs, feed, and sitemap from the same database
write. Use `--draft` to save a non-public record or `--archive` to remove a
record from public responses without deleting its revision history.

The first database-backed release needs one import from the private migration
bundle. Loop records and bootstrap data are intentionally not committed to
GitHub:

```bash
LOOP_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... \
  npm --prefix worker run loops:import -- /private/path/bootstrap.json
```

Set a long random `LOOP_PUBLISH_TOKEN` as a Worker secret. The catalog uses a
SQLite-backed Durable Object and keeps an append-only revision for every
publish. The reviewed bootstrap digest is enforced before the database can be
activated.

Create a private backup of the current database with:

```bash
LOOP_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... \
  npm --prefix worker run loops:export -- /private/path/catalog-backup.ndjson
```

Restore that snapshot only into a fresh, empty catalog database:

```bash
LOOP_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... \
  npm --prefix worker run loops:restore -- /private/path/catalog-backup.ndjson
```

Bootstrap and backup files must be owner-only (`chmod 600`). Exports include
drafts, archived records, and complete revision history; keep them outside the
repository.

The current Git tree contains the site shell and rendering code, but no
published loop records, generated loop pages, catalogs, feed, sitemap, or
offline catalog fallback. The legacy catalog and source-attribution metadata
were already public and intentionally remain in pre-migration Git history;
this migration does not rewrite repository history or disrupt existing clones.

### Preview locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory site
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

### Validate a change

```bash
npm ci --prefix worker
node --check site/script.js
node scripts/check.mjs
npm --prefix worker run check
python3 -m json.tool site/.herenow/data.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool scripts/seo-geo-query-benchmark.json >/dev/null
git diff --check
```

### Configure voting

Voting is stored in a dedicated SQLite Durable Object. Reading totals is
public, but casting, changing, or removing a vote requires a GitHub login.
Set `SESSION_SECRET` and the GitHub OAuth client credentials as Worker
secrets; use `worker/.dev.vars.example` for local variable names only. Register
the canonical callbacks shown in `AGENTS.md`, then deploy the Worker before the
site shell because the shell calls the new auth and vote routes.

The production launch is fail-closed. Keep `VOTING_UI_ENABLED=false` while the
Worker and proxy are deployed, then complete a GitHub login, session, vote,
reload, and logout smoke test on the canonical domain. Set the value to the
exact string `true` and redeploy only the Worker after the smoke test passes;
the already-published site will reveal voting without another site publish.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before editing loops or publishing the site. It
contains the source-of-truth rules for database publishing, generated
responses, form security, and clean-main deployments.
