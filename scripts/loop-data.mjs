      "Argue against your own design until it survives. In each round, a critic sub-agent writes the strongest case that the current approach is wrong and records every objection in /tmp/redteam-{projectname}.md with its evidence, impact, and status. The builder must either fix the weakness and verify the result or record why accepting it is reasonable under the project's stated criteria. The critic then reviews the change or acceptance rationale and may reopen anything that is not supported. Repeat until no new high-impact objection appears and every logged objection is either verified as resolved or explicitly accepted with evidence. Merely answering an objection in the log does not resolve it. If the same unresolved objections repeat for two rounds without new evidence or progress, stop and report the stalemate instead of claiming the design survived.",
